Data synchornization library:
fetching, caching, updating

Sources:
REST  
GraphQL
(as long as it returns a promise)

Stale-While-Revalidate
Cached data as often as possible
While updating that data in the background as often as it makes sense for the components that consume it.

Codevoorbeeld useQuery
You provide the fetching logic (function) that fetches the data
and it takes care of everything else automatically, such as fetching, caching, background updates and garbage collection

You can place React Query queries anywhere in your application without worrying about duplicate network requests,
or managing global state or using context

You can also configure React Query to do cool things such as request cancellation, offline support, prefetching, pagination, etc.

And it has dedicated dev tools
