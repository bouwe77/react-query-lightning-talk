# What is/does React Query? âš›

    - Data synchronization library: fetching, caching, updating, background updates

    - You provide fetching and mutation logic and React Query takes care of the rest

    - Data sources: REST, GraphQL, etc., as long as it returns a promise

    - Dedicated dev tools

    - Stale-While-Revalidate strategy: Immediately response from the cache, but if necessary, refresh the cache in the background.

    - Also: request cancellation, offline support, prefetching, pagination, etc.
