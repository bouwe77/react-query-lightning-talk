# What is React Query? âš›

    - Data synchronization library: fetching, caching, updating, background updates

    - You provide fetching and mutation logic and React Query takes care of the rest

    - Data sources: REST, GraphQL, etc., as long as it returns a promise

    - Dedicated dev tools

    - Stale-While-Revalidate

Cached data as often as possible
While updating that data in the background as often as it makes sense for the components that consume it.

    - Also: request cancellation, offline support, prefetching, pagination, etc.
